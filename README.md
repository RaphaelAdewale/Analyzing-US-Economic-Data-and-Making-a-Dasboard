# Analyzing-US-Economic-Data-and-Making-a-Dasboard
Analyzing data is an integral part of data science.
In this project, i analyzed US Economic data and built a dashboard to illustrate the data.
I will extract some essential economic indicators from the data and display these economic indicators in a dashboard.
<b>GDP</b> is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. 
A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in <b>GDP</b> suggests the economy is performing better. 
In the notebook, I will examine how changes in GDP impact the <b>unemployment</b> rate. 
I will eventually define a function <code>make_dashboard</code> to build a <b>dashboard</b> to illustrate the analysis.
